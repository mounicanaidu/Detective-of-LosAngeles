At least twice a day, I hear sirens and choppers in the air. I have always wondered what is happening around me. What kind of crimes are committed, who is being affected the most, whats the age group, how safe is my locality and many such questions. In this project, I intend to investigate the crime data from [Los Angeles Open Data](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Crime-Data-from-2010-to-Present/y8tr-7khq) to answer these questions. The main aim of this project is Data Exploration.

__Burglary from Vehicle__ has been on the rise since 2014 and is increasing at a fast rate. __Battery - Simple Assault__ is the highest commited crime.

Crime rate is least from 5am to 6am and then slowly rises to each a peak at 12:00pm (needs further investigation) and then gradually drops.

Most commited crime at sharp 12pm is 'Theft of Identity'. My intuition is that LAPD assigns unknown crime time to 12pm as a default value. This needs to be confirmed by investigating it further.

Interestingly, the 'Theft of Identity' crime rate has been falling. That's a good sign. My assumption for decreasing crime rate is because people are more aware of such crimes and are taking precautions. Another possible assumption is due to multiple verification processes of identity by various organisations (for example banks), such crimes have reduced.
